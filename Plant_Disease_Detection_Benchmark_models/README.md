# Plant Disease Detection Benchmark models


**Objective:**
- Using different neural network Archetectures implement Neural Net Prediction Model ,Sothat we may have a baseline model accuracy to compare the future progress

**Resources:**
- [Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03169.pdf)
- [Data set](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)
- [Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)
