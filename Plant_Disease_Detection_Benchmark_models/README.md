[Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)

Approches for Solving the papers realtime Detection Problem

	phase 1 : implement the paper 
	phase 2 : do analysis on the paper and identify the type of data problem 
	phase 3 : experement and if possible generate Apprprate data
		  using the data train the model again
