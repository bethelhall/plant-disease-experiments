# Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

[Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03169.pdf) 

**Resources:**
- [Data set](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)

- [Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)



**Objective**

- Train and Evaluate different DNN Models for plant deasise detection Problem

- To tackle the problem of scarce real-life representative data, experiment with different generative networks and generate more plant leaf image data

- Implement segmentation pipeline to avoid missclassification due to unwanted input 



**Approches for Solving the papers realtime Detection Problem**

phase 1 : [implement the paper](https://github.com/singnet/plant-disease-experiments/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models) 

phase 2 : do analysis on the paper and identify the type of data problem 

phase 3 : [experement and if possible generate Apprprate data
		  using the data train the model again](https://github.com/singnet/plant_disease_experements/tree/master/Plant_Disease_Detection_gan_experimants)


# Project Structure

**Plant_Disease_Detection_Benchmark_models**

- Train and test different prediction models to get a baseline accuracy to compare to and see progress

**Plant_Disease_Detection_gan_experiments**

- experiment with different generative networks to see their generative capability and if the output can be used to train more robust models

**leaf-image-segmentation-segnet**

- segmentation pipline using VGGSegNet Architecture

**leaf-image-segmentation**

- histogram based segmentation Pipline
